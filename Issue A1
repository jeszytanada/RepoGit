Branch Forcing:
**HEAD is the current place where the pointer is pointing (ex. if you are on the branch master then the HEAD is there; if you are on the commit with name C2 then the HEAD points there.) 

e.g. git branch -f master C6

→ -f meaning force even the head is not pointing to that branch
→ master is the branch to move
→ C6 is the commit where the master will be moved

e.g. git branch -f bugFix HEAD~1

→ -f meaning force even the head is not pointing to that branch
→ bugFix is the branch that is needed to be moved
→ above the HEAD is where we are going to put the bugFix branch
