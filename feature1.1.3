might notice you at the edge of the field
with your banners and bottled cells? A
managed tot, from the womb unstoppered,

Brained-up for the stupids. Don’t grow!
Don’t rise into big citizenship! Soul underling,
soul malingering at the gate! Till the end of  the

body’s time: Unicorn, my little porn. Wanted
To unhunger her too, I. But she filled the screen
in that field of dying flowers. Famous-eyed,
turned away from the gift of sustenance, brave: no
semblance of a future beyond everyone’s fake-maternal mind.

Liars’ banners. Then the unicorn’s  passage: lightfoot.

And so loved, lightfoot, so apparently loved:
Some of us must starve in order to be seen.
